title: ADR001: Architecture Decision Record (ADR) log
description: Architecture Decision Record (ADR) logs as a reference point for the team
---

## Decision

A decision was made to store ADRs in a log in the project repository

## Discussion

There is a need to store big decisions made in a log as a reference point for
the team, help with onboarding new members and give context to others interested
in the project.

Checking to see if the greater than eighty character limit will happen when i
submit a sentance that has more than eighty in it, if it works then i can submit
this document to backstage proper where all future docs can be have a eighty
character limit check automatically written

## Risks

People stop adding ADRs to the log and context gets lost
